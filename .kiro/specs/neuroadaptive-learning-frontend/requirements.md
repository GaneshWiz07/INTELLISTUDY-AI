# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Neuroadaptive Learning AI Frontend is a React-based web application that provides an adaptive learning platform capable of adjusting content delivery in real-time based on learner engagement and emotional state. The system monitors user behavior through webcam integration, interaction patterns, and explicit feedback to create a personalized learning experience. This frontend will serve as the user interface for students and administrators, with backend integration capabilities for AI-powered emotion detection and adaptive learning algorithms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to authenticate into the platform with role-based access, so that I can access personalized learning content and track my progress securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a login form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user clicks "Sign Up" THEN the system SHALL display a registration form with name, email, password, and role selection
3. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to the appropriate dashboard based on role
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with validation feedback
5. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain session state and provide role-based navigation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want a personalized dashboard that shows my learning progress and current state, so that I can understand my performance and engagement levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student logs in THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message with the learner's name
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show a session overview card displaying current focus and attention state
3. WHEN displaying statistics THEN the system SHALL show recent performance metrics, last mood state, and engagement score using Chart.js visualizations
4. WHEN the dashboard is active THEN the system SHALL update engagement metrics in real-time (initially mocked)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want an interactive learning session interface that adapts content based on my engagement level, so that I can learn more effectively through personalized content delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a learning session starts THEN the system SHALL display a modular content component that can switch between text, video, quiz, and infographic formats
2. WHEN content is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide engagement state buttons (High/Medium/Low) for testing dynamic adaptation
3. WHEN engagement level changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the UI and content type in real-time based on the detected state
4. WHEN content adaptation occurs THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition between different content formats within the same session
5. WHEN a session is active THEN the system SHALL track and log all engagement interactions for analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want the system to monitor my engagement through webcam and interaction behavior, so that the platform can automatically adapt to my learning needs without manual input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a learning session begins THEN the system SHALL provide a webcam toggle component using react-webcam library
2. WHEN webcam is enabled THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder area ready for eye tracking and emotion recognition API integration
3. WHEN a user interacts with the platform THEN the system SHALL track mouse activity, scroll speed, and typing activity using custom hooks
4. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL collect engagement data and prepare it for backend API integration
5. WHEN privacy is a concern THEN the system SHALL allow users to disable webcam monitoring while maintaining interaction tracking

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want the system to intelligently adapt content based on my current state, so that I receive the most appropriate learning material for my situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student appears bored with text content THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to video format
2. WHEN a student shows confusion with video content THEN the system SHALL present quiz or interactive content
3. WHEN content adaptation occurs THEN the system SHALL render different content types dynamically within a single learning session
4. WHEN multiple adaptations happen THEN the system SHALL maintain learning continuity and context
5. WHEN adaptation logic runs THEN the system SHALL use mocked learner states initially with backend integration readiness

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student and administrator, I want detailed engagement and emotion reporting, so that I can analyze learning patterns and optimize the educational experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the reporting dashboard THEN the system SHALL display attention trend graphs using Chart.js
2. WHEN viewing session data THEN the system SHALL show emotion timeline during learning sessions
3. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL provide exportable session reports in PDF or CSV format
4. WHEN analyzing data THEN the system SHALL present engagement metrics in visually clear and actionable formats
5. WHEN historical data exists THEN the system SHALL allow comparison between different sessions and time periods

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a student, I want a comprehensive user profile page, so that I can manage my learning preferences and track my progress over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the profile page THEN the system SHALL display personal learning style preferences (text/video preference)
2. WHEN viewing session history THEN the system SHALL show data from the last 5 sessions with key metrics
3. WHEN tracking progress THEN the system SHALL display learning streak information and personal goals
4. WHEN updating preferences THEN the system SHALL save changes and apply them to future learning sessions
5. WHEN profile data loads THEN the system SHALL use mocked data initially with backend integration capability

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want an admin panel to manage users and monitor system performance, so that I can oversee the platform and optimize learning outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin logs in THEN the system SHALL provide access to view all registered users
2. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL display session-wise engagement comparison across users
3. WHEN system optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL provide interface to trigger backend retraining or adaptation logic manually
4. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL allow basic user management operations
5. WHEN accessing admin features THEN the system SHALL ensure proper role-based access control

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular and scalable React application architecture, so that the system can be easily maintained and extended with new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL use React with Vite for optimal development experience
2. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL implement modular component architecture with clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN integrating with backend THEN the system SHALL provide API integration placeholders ready for Flask/FastAPI connection
4. WHEN building components THEN the system SHALL ensure reusability and maintainability across different modules
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL be contained within a separate frontend folder for independent deployment

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and intuitive user interface, so that I can effectively use the platform across different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. WHEN navigating the interface THEN the system SHALL offer intuitive user experience with clear visual hierarchy
3. WHEN interacting with components THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and smooth transitions
